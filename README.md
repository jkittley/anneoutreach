# Ocean-Scan

### Arduino --[serial]--> Raspberry Pi --[web socket]--> Webserver (can also be on Pi) --[web socket]--> HTML5 Webpages

This repo contains a basic framework which allows JSON encoded data to be transfered from an Arduino (or other serial 
capable dev board) to locally hosted website (on a Raspberry Pi). It uses web sockets to provide realtime updates. This
 code was required as part of a larger project whcih can be found here: http://thing.farm/ocean-scan. 

## Setup 
First of all I am going to assume you have a Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian installed and setup to connect to the internet.
Older models of the Pi will work, but if you intend to use the Pi's browser to display the page it is worth using the 
latest model.

Launch command line and run the following to insure the system is up-to-date
* sudo apt-get update

Next make sure you have the Epiphany browser installed
* sudo apt-get install epiphany-browser

Check you have Python 3 and Pip installed
* sudo apt-get install python3-pip

Move to the user directory
* cd ~/

Make a new directory for the web server and move into it
* mkdir www 
* cd www

Download the project code from github
* git clone https://github.com/jkittley/ocean-scan.git

Move into the directory 
* cd ocean-scan

Install all the python requirements
* pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Copy all the files from the from useful_tools to the raspberry pi desktop 
* cp useful_tools/*.sh ~/Desktop

You must then make the usefull tools executable
* chmod +x ~/Desktop/*.sh

That's it, now we can launch the services.

You can either run: 
* python3 serialmonitor.py --prod &
* sudo python3 webserver.py â€”prod

or double click on the new icons on the desktop and choose execute in terminal

Once the server is up and running you can open the browser and go to localhost to see the website or from a remote 
machine you can enter the Raspberry Pi's IP address. The IP address can be discovered by double clicking on the 
"whats_my_ip" usefull tool now on the desktop
